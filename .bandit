# Bandit configuration for vigilant-octo-engine
# Security scanning configuration for Python code

[bandit]
# Exclude test files and virtual environments
exclude_dirs = ['/tests/', '/venv/', '/.venv/', '/env/', '/build/', '/dist/']

# Test to skip (use with caution - document why each is skipped)
skips = []

# Severity level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
# Only report issues at or above this level
# For production code: use LOW
# For initial scans: use MEDIUM to reduce noise
# Current: MEDIUM (flags demo credentials as expected)

# Confidence level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
# Only report issues with at least this confidence
# Current: MEDIUM (reduces false positives)

[bandit.baseline]
# Use bandit -f json -o baseline.json to create baseline
# Then: bandit -b baseline.json to only report new issues
# baseline = baseline.json

[bandit.formatters]
# Available: csv, json, txt, html, custom, screen, yaml
